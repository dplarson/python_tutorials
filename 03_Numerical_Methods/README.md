# Numerical Methods

## Requirements
- numpy
- scipy

## Demo application
- something related to heat transfer (maybe fluids or mass transfer)
- solve some sort of simple, but common problem
- compare to analytical or experimental results (provide students with data)
- tweak parameters and compare (e.g. grid size and time step)
- go from just solving a problem => using results to make an engineering decision
