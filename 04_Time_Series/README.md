Time series analysis using pandas.

## Requirements

## Demo applications
- energy usage in Britain between TV shows (everyone makes tea at the same time => spike in the load)
- water usage during sports games (happens during the breaks)
- outline:
    - import some data
    - clean up and organize the data
    - plot the data
    - use visual inspection to direct next steps
    - make some sort of conclusions (maybe with plots)
