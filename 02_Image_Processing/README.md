# Image Processing

## Requirements
- opencv

## Demo application
- percentage of pepperoni on a pizza
    - import image of a pizza
    - convert image to 3D array (3 layers: red, green, blue)
    - pepperoni is going to be red => calculate number of pixels with lots of red and compare to the total number of pixels
- detect object in an image
    - go with something simple (e.g. a green ball)
    - include some parameters that can be tweaked (for students to play with)
    - maybe progress to running the detection on multiple images and adding an outline to the identified objects
