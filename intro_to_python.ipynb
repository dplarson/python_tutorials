    "where $F$ is the force at the center, $L$ is the length of the beam, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity of the material, and $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/), the iPhone 6 is 138.1mm long, 67.0mm wide, and 6.9mm thick. If we assume the iPhone is one solid piece of aluminum 6061, $E$ is 69 GPa (69x10^9 Pa). And the $I$ for a beam is\n",
