Files for learning Python using iPython Notebook.

## Requirements

The easiest way to install Python and the above packages is using Anaconda, a free Python distribution created by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/) that is compatible with Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. To install:

1. download the Python 2.7 installer for your OS here: http://continuum.io/downloads
2. run the installer
3. check that the install worked by opening "Launcher" (a graphic interface installed as part of Anaconda) and "launch" ipython-notebook (which will open in your web browser)
